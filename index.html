        Toyota Motor Corporation is a Japanese multinational automotive 
        manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. It was 
        founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937.

        The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, 
        a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both 
        companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest 
        conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, 
        the company developed its first product, the Type A engine in 1934 and its 
        first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.
